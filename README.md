# CLIPfa: Connecting Farsi Text and Images
OpenAI released [`the paper Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020) in which they present the CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) model. This model is trained to connect text and images, by matching their corresponding vector representations using a contrastive learning objective. CLIP consists of two separate models, a vision encoder and a text encoder. These were trained on a wooping 400 Million images and corresponding captions. We have trained a Farsi (Persian) version of OpenAI's CLIP on a dataset of 400,000 (image, text) pairs. We used [`Farahani's RoBERTa-fa`](https://huggingface.co/m3hrdadfi/roberta-zwnj-wnli-mean-tokens) as the text encoder and [‍‍`ViT‍`](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch32) as the vision encoder from Original CLIP and finetuned them.

It should be noted that only 400K pairs were used for this training, whereas 4 million pairs were used for the Original CLIP. Also, the training took 30 days across 592 GPUs powered by the V100 chip.
 

## How to use?
Both models generate vectors with 768 dimensions.
```python
from transformers import CLIPVisionModel, RobertaModel, AutoTokenizer, CLIPFeatureExtractor
# download pre-trained models
vision_encoder = CLIPVisionModel.from_pretrained('SajjadAyoubi/clip-fa-vision')
preprocessor = CLIPFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('SajjadAyoubi/clip-fa-vision')
text_encoder = RobertaModel.from_pretrained('SajjadAyoubi/clip-fa-text')
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('SajjadAyoubi/clip-fa-text')
# define input image and input text
text = 'something'
image = PIL.Image.open('my_favorite_image.jpg')
# compute embeddings
text_embedding = text_encoder(**tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')).pooler_output
image_embedding = vision_encoder(**preprocessor(image, return_tensors='pt')).pooler_output
text_embedding.shape == image_embedding.shape
```

## Demo:
The followings are just some use cases of CLIPfa on 25K [`Unsplash images`](https://github.com/unsplash/datasets)
- use `pip install -q git+https://github.com/sajjjadayobi/clipfa.git`
```python
from clipfa import CLIPDemo
demo = CLIPDemo(vision_encoder, text_encoder, tokenizer)
demo.compute_text_embeddings(['گاو' ,'اسب' ,'ماهی'])
demo.compute_image_embeddings(test_df.image_path.to_list())
```

## Online Demo: [CLIPfa at Huggingface🤗 spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SajjadAyoubi/CLIPfa-Demo)
We used a small set of images (25K) to keep this app almost real-time, but it's obvious that the quality of image search depends heavily on the size of the image database.

## Dataset:
### Training v1 (400K)
We started with this question that how much the original Clip model depends on its big training dataset containing a lot of conceptual samples. Our model shows that It is possible to meet an acceptable enough target with only a little amount of data even though, It may not have known enough concepts and subjects to be used widely. Our model trained on a dataset gathered from different resources such as The Flickr30k, MS-COCO 2017, Google CCm3, ... . We used these datasets and translated them into the Persian language with a [`tool`](https://github.com/sajjjadayobi/CLIPfa/blob/main/clipfa/data/translation.py) prepared by ourselves. Using the Google Translate and Multilingual Similarity Check method we provided an automatic translator that has been given a list of English captions and filtered by the best translations.

### Available v2 (20M)
We started with the Persian(Farsi) subset of the [`LAION-2B-multi`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion2B-multi) dataset and released a cleaned version called [`LAION-20M-fa`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amir7d0/laion20M-fa). We used [`image2dataset`](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset)  to download LAION-20M-fa dataset images. Then we calculated the similarity of the image and text embeddings with CLIP-fa. After the similarity score was established we removed the pairs under the threshold we decided to use, i.e 0.50 for the Persian dataset. Then we used a small portion of LAION-20M-fa to fine-tune CLIP-fa v2 because of computation restrictions.
- It'd be appreciated if someone with access to some GPUs could train the model on the whole dataset and share it with the community.


## Training: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/sajjjadayobi/CLIPfa/blob/main/notebook/CLIPfa_Training.ipynb"><img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face&message=CLIPfa Training&color=white"></a>
Any dataset can be used with little change by the [`training code`](https://github.com/sajjjadayobi/CLIPfa/tree/main/clipfa). CLIPfa can be trained with other encoders as long as they have the same hidden size at the last layer.  In [`this`](https://github.com/sajjjadayobi/CLIPfa/blob/main/notebook/CLIPfa_Training.ipynb) notebook I used [`training code`](https://github.com/sajjjadayobi/CLIPfa/tree/main/clipfa) to train a small CLIP on translated [‍`flickr30K`](https://www.kaggle.com/sajjadayobi360/flickrfa) dataset.
